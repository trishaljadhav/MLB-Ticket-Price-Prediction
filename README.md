# MLB-Ticket-Price-Prediction
Scraped MLB season ticket prices for the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets. Used Machine Learning techniques such as Lasso Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest to build a model for future price prediction and selected the best model based on performance with out-of-sample data.

You can find the Jupyter Notebook with the project under MLB_Ticket_Price_Prediction.ipynb and the scraped data under Giants.json and Mets.json.
